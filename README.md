The "Stock Price Prediction" Streamlit app offers users a straightforward interface for forecasting stock prices using historical data and a pre-trained deep learning model. Users input a stock ticker symbol, and the app retrieves historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance. It then provides a descriptive summary of the data and visualizes key metrics like Close price and moving averages (MA) such as MA30 and MA100.

The app employs a deep learning model, loaded from a Keras model file, to predict future stock prices based on the historical data. After prediction, it compares the predicted prices with the actual prices to assess accuracy. This tool is valuable for investors, traders, and analysts seeking insights into potential future price movements for informed decision-making. To deploy on GitHub, ensure all dependencies are documented, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Keras, Streamlit, and yfinance, along with setup instructions. Additionally, provide details about the deep learning model's architecture and training process for transparency and reproducibility.
